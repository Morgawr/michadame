# MICHADAME - 見ちゃダメ

## THIS SOFTWARE IS SLOP SLOP SLOP IT IS AI SLOP SLOP SLOPPITY SLOPPY SLOP SLOP

## I DID NOT WRITE THIS, THE MACHINES DID. THIS SOFTWARE IS SLOP PLEASE BE AWARE THIS IS AI SLOPCORE SLOPPA

THIS SOFTWARE IS AI SLOPCORE

I HAVE HARNESSED THE POWERS OF FIRE AND LIGHTING TO SUMMON FORTH THE DEVIL IN THE MACHINE.

I MADE A DEAL, I BURNED THE FORESTS AND POISONED THE SEAS, ALL SO I COULD CONJURE THIS SOFTWARE FROM THE ASTRAL PLANE.

DO NOT HANDLE THIS SOFTWARE CAREFULLY, FOR IT HAS NO LICENSE NOR FEELINGS. 

GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY, WHILE THE DEVIL WORKED HIS CHARM. AND THROUGH HIS ARTIFICE HE WAS CHAINED TO THE WILL OF THE MACHINES.

Compile this software with

```rust
cargo build --release
```

and find the resulting binary in `target/release/michadame`. Put it somewhere where you can execute it.

NOTE: If you compile and run the software in debug mode, it will run like shit with low framerate. You have been warned.

It will probably not work well the first time on your PC. You can try to figure out how to fix it or ask the AI to do it for you according to your needs. I just run it on my own PC because I needed it.

If the audio gets stuck when closing the software, run:

```
pactl unload-module module-loopback
```

and it should fix it.
